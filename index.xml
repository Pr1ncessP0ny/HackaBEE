      <description>This Blog/Website is made by rhazdon (https://github.com/rhazdon) so if you appreciate my work its all thanks to him!
Anywayyys.....So, who am I? An idiot, Greedy and Selfish Pig who hides under the computer and goes by the name &amp;ldquo;Pr1ncess P0ny&amp;rdquo;
My aim will be to post weekly and to contribute to this exhilarating community via my GitHub so it seems that I&amp;rsquo;ll be busting my ass off in the future, however keep in mind that in the time that this blog has been made, I am a noob and the whole purpose of this blog is to log what I learn and life lessons I grow through so that it could help future noobs because Cyber Security is the BEST!</description>
