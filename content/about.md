<h3>Anywayyys.....So, who am I?</h3>

well, I'm just an enthusiast about cyber security with questions firing off rapidly from my head that I desire answers to. This blog is like a personal time machine in a sense, showing me where I started from and where I will be in the future.

Feel free to browse through this blog it may end up serving as a ladder towards the life of a pen-tester / Veterans Bug bounty hunter or something completely different.
