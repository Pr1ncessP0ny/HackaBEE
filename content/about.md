<h3>Anywayyys.....So, who am I?</h3>

well, I'm just an enthusiast about cyber security who wants to contribute towards this wonderful community.

Feel free to browse through this blog, it may end up serving as a ladder towards the life of a pen-tester / Veteran Bug bounty hunter or something completely different as I intend to share the lessons I grow through, what I learn, my ideas on projects, etc.
